        title: "The Serial Killer",
        summary: "A buried confession in Lodhi Gardens reopens a century-old killing spree. \n\nOne hundred years ago, a serial killer terrorized the city, brutally murdering ten victims in a pattern so precise it haunted investigators for decades. Eight suspects were named, but with no conclusive evidence, the case collapsed—and the killer was never brought to justice.\n\nNow, a hidden box discovered in the soil of what was once Khairpur village has reopened the investigation. Inside are the personal belongings of the victims and a long-lost confession letter containing information powerful enough to expose the real murderer.\n\nWith time running out and history demanding answers, the entire case file has been handed to you. Your task is to analyze the evidence, identify the true killer among the eight suspects, and finally close a case the world believed would remain unsolved forever.\n\nBut investigators warn: nothing in this case is what it appears to be.",

        summary: "Ananya Mehta, a 22-year-old woman, was found dead inside her locked bedroom, sending shockwaves through the neighborhood and leaving investigators with more questions than answers.\n\nWith no signs of forced entry and no indication that anyone had entered or exited the house, suspicion initially fell on her parents—Suresh Mehta and Ritu Mehta, the only other occupants of the home.\n\nHowever, after multiple investigations and exhaustive inquiries, police failed to find any concrete evidence linking them to the death. Every lead was followed. Every theory examined. One by one, all explanations collapsed, pushing the case into a cold, unresolved mystery.\n\nNow, the complete case file—police reports, forensic findings, and overlooked clues—has been handed over to you. Your task is to re-examine the evidence and uncover what truly happened behind that locked door.\n\nBecause in this case, nothing is as it seems.",

        summary: "Five people are found dead across different cities, from different families, with no apparent connection—except one chilling detail: each of them owned the same book.\n\nRumored to be cursed, the book is said to seal the fate of anyone who possesses it. What began as a dark legend has now left five confirmed victims in its wake.\n\nPolice investigations have gone nowhere. Every theory has collapsed, and every lead has gone cold. With no logical explanation and only fragments of the mysterious book recovered, authorities are left with more questions than answers.\n\nNow, the case has been handed over to you. Armed with evidence, reports, and a few surviving pages from the book, your task is to determine whether these deaths are the result of coincidence, manipulation, or something far more calculated.\n\nBecause in this investigation, belief and reality are dangerously intertwined.",

        summary: "Dr. Maya Sharma, a respected psychology professor at Ganga Valley University, vanished without a trace on Tuesday, August 5th, 2025.\n\nWith no signs of struggle, no farewell, and no confirmed sightings since, investigators are unable to determine whether she is missing, murdered, or deliberately hiding.\n\nPolice spent days interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence, yet the case produced no clear answers. Every theory collapsed under scrutiny, leaving authorities with a growing file and no resolution.\n\nNow, the entire investigation—interviews, reports, and unanswered questions—has been transferred to you. Your task is to reconstruct Dr. Sharma’s final days and uncover what truly happened.\n\nBecause in this case, the truth is far more complex than it first appears.",

        summary: "All seven members of the Kapoor family were found dead—each death occurring on the seventh day of the week (Sunday), at exactly 7:00 PM.\n\nThe precision of the timing was impossible to ignore. Authorities ruled the deaths natural at first glance, yet the pattern raised serious doubts about coincidence.\n\nInside the Kapoor residence, investigators uncovered disturbing discoveries: strange symbols drawn across the walls, ritual candles, occult books, and materials suggesting involvement with supernatural practices. Whether these items played a role in the deaths—or were deliberately planted to mislead investigators—remains unclear.\n\nDespite weeks of investigation, police failed to determine what truly killed the family. Now, the entire case file has been handed over to you. Your task is to separate fact from superstition and uncover what really happened inside the Kapoor home.\n\nBecause when belief and deception collide, the truth hides in plain sight.",

        title: "The Haunted School",
        summary: "Two students vanish from an elite boarding school hidden deep in the forests of Sikkim—leaving behind a radio signal that refuses to go silent.\n\nValourhouse International, long known for discipline and prestige, is now at the center of a disturbing mystery. Two years ago, 17-year-old Aarav Mehta disappeared without a struggle or a trace. The only evidence left behind was his abandoned radio booth, faint static still transmitting, pages from his log diary, and a final note that read: “Someone’s listening.”\n\nNow, history appears to be repeating itself. Another student, Rayan Kapoor, has vanished after reviving Aarav’s old late-night radio show—The Confession Frequency—a platform where students anonymously shared secrets after dark. What began as harmless broadcasts soon turned unsettling, as confessions aired that no one had submitted, always at exactly 11:11 PM, always in the same voice.\n\nDuring the investigation, police uncovered a hidden tunnel beneath the school, connecting the radio room to an uncharted cave system under the forest floor—built by unknown hands, with no records or explanation. With the case escalating and fear spreading across campus, authorities have turned to you.\n\nNow granted full access to Valourhouse, your task is to trace the disappearances, decode the confessions, and uncover what—or who—is really transmitting from beneath the school.\n\nBecause this is not just a missing-person case.\nThe signal is active. And someone is waiting for you to listen.",
